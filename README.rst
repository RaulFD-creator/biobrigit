Brigit is a computational tool designed for the prediction of protein-metal
binding sites in proteins. It uses a novel scoring function powered by
a deep learning model and previous domain knowledge regarding bioinorganic
interactions.

The deep learning model used is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that
interprets the physico-chemical environment. The previous domain knowledge is 
based on the works by SÃ¡nchez-Aparicio et al. (2017), and translates into the 
use of statistics to score the suitability of a point of space based on its 
relative position to certain atoms in the protein backbone.

Features
--------
**Diferent options for customizing the search:**

* Search for binding sites of specific residues.
* Filter results according to how likely they are to bind metals.
* Takes into account binding with backbone nitrogens and oxygens.
* Scanning the whole protein, though, a region can also be provided as 
input (in PDB format).

**Modular design:**
* The modular design of this packages allows for its use as a command-line
tool or to be integrated into a larger program or pipeline.

**Possible applications:**
* Screening of a pool of `.pdb` structures.
* Identification of conformational changes that alter the formation of metal-binding sites.
* Identification of probable paths that the metals might have to traverse
to transitorily binding regions before reaching the more stable, final, binding site.
* Metalloenzyme design.
* Metallodrug design.
