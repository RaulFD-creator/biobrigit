Brigit is a computational tool designed for the prediction of protein-metal
binding sites in proteins. It uses a novel scoring function powered by
a deep learning model and previous domain knowledge regarding bioinorganic
interactions.

The deep learning model used is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that
interprets the physico-chemical environment. The previous domain knowledge is 
based on the works by SÃ¡nchez-Aparicio et al. (2017), and translates into the 
use of statistics to score the suitability of a point of space based on its 
relative position to certain atoms in the protein backbone.
